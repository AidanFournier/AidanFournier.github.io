    Evidence-collecting app for victims of abuse. Users can document incidents, generate police reports in Japanese, and connect with other users who have the same abuser using facial-recogntion technology.
    As the lead Front-End Developer for this project, I had to think about how to design the app with mobile-first function in mind. I challenged myself by learning how to use Stimulus.js and create wireframes on Figma.

  description: A marketplace app for renting or lending camping gear. My team built this MVC app in two weeks. We used the Cloudinary and Mapbox APIs as well as the JS plugin Flatpickr.

  description: This mobile-first application provides gameplay support for Animal Crossing New Horizons. This is my first independent project built with React.js. Along with using hooks for State and Effect, I challenged myself by using a library called Axios to support the API calls in the app.
